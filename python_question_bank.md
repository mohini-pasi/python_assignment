8. **How to check if a variable is a certain type?**
   - Answer: Use `isinstance(var, type)` or `type(var) is type`.

9. **What is the difference between `list` and `tuple`?**
   - Answer: Lists are mutable (can be modified), tuples are immutable. Lists use `[]`, tuples use `()`.

10. **How to reverse a string in Python?**

      ```

21. **What is the difference between `append()` and `extend()` for lists?**
    - Answer: `append()` adds its argument as a single element, while `extend()` iterates over its argument adding each element.

22. **How to remove duplicates from a list?**

      unique_list = list(set(my_list))  # doesn't preserve order
      # or
      from collections import OrderedDict
      unique_list = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(my_list))  # preserves order
      ```

23. **What is the difference between `remove()`, `pop()` and `del` for lists?**
    - Answer: `remove()` deletes the first matching value, `pop()` removes by index (and returns it), `del` removes by index or slice.

      ```python
      import os
      os.getcwd()
      ```
